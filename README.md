# nc-police-certification-data

The [Wandering Officer article](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-wandering-officer) published in the Yale Law Journal by Ben Grunwald and John Rappaport in April 2020 defines wandering officers as "law-enforcement officers fired by one department, sometimes for serious misconduct, who then find work at another agency."

Earlier this year, we obtained a dataset from the North Carolina Department of Justice that tracks actions taken on N.C. police officer's certifications going back to 1973, when this data collection started.

It is our goal to identify wandering officers in North Carolina.

The N.C. Department of Justice provided the following definitions for the values in the ACTIONSTATUS column in the data set:

<b>Active (Active)</b> - This is any certification other than a Law Enforcement Officer/Deputy Sheriff/Telecommunicator that is in an active status. Typically you will see these for instructor certifications, firearms certifications, etc.

<b>Application (Active)</b> - This is an active application for certification. The person has applied for certification but has not yet been issued a certification.

<b>Denied (Inactive)</b> - This certification has been denied and was not issued.

<b>General (Active)</b> - This is an active certification for Law Enforcement Officers/Deputies/Telecommunicators who have passed their probationary period and are in good standing.

<b>Grandfathered (Active)</b> - This is an active certification for Law Enforcement Officers/Deputies/Telecommunicators who attended training prior to changes to our rules/laws and have maintained active employment under older guidelines.

<b>Not Yet Issued (Inactive)</b> - This is a status for a certification which in most cases has been approved for a future date and not yet been issued. This is often used when we post-date a certification so that a large group of can be issued all at once even through we are entering them in over the course of several days. (an example might be for a graduating class at a state agency who have already met their certification requirements but the agency doesn't intend to swear them in until a certain date a few weeks out.)

<b>Pending Active (Active)</b> - Certification is pending and the person is working (this is only for Sheriff's Standards)

<b>Pending Inactive (Inactive)</b> - Certification is pending but the person is not working (this is only for Sheriff's Standards)

<b>Probationary (Active)</b> - This is an active certification for Law Enforcement Officers/Deputies/Telecommunicators who are inside of their 1 year probationary period.

<b>Revoked (Inactive)</b> - This certification has been revoked by one of the Commissions.

<b>Separated (Inactive)</b> - This certification is no longer valid due to the person separating from their agency. Certifications in NC are tied to the specific agency they are employed by.

<b>Surrendered (Inactive)</b> - This certification was voluntarily surrendered by the person holding it and is no longer valid.

<b>Suspended (Inactive)</b> - This certification has been suspended by one of the Commissions and is not valid while in this status.

<b>Suspended â€“ Failure to Complete Firearms Qualification (Inactive)</b> - This certification has been temporarily suspended due to an officer not qualifying with their duty firearm. It is not valid while in this status, but this is often only a status for a matter of days or weeks while the person tries to re-qualify on their weapon.
